## 2.Story
* **Introduction**  

>>Plants help clean our air, as well as produce clean oxygen for other living creatures that need it; They also protect us from many natural disasters. For that and many other reasons, a lot of people like to take care of plants of their own. Some people know how to take care of them, but a lot of people don't know how to take care their plants properly. The “Plant Monitor”, is a device that has two main sensors: a moisture sensor(nail), and a humidity and temperature sensor (DHT22). By utilizing these sensors, the device will be able to tell the plants’ owner about the plant’s moisture,humidity and temperature levels. The owner should know the best levels of moisture, humidity and temperature for plants to grow, comparising with the indicator values on the Plant Monitor, do some measures to keep plants well.  

* **Demonstration Picture**
 >>Before your build-up, your need to have a clear overview about how the device looks like, this picture shows the plant monitor, when putting the nails in the soil, the whole circuit is complete,running the sketch on Arduino,it will show m,t,h value.
